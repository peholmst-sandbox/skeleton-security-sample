/**
 * Service interface for looking up {@link AppUserInfo} details for any user in the system.
 * <p>
 * Unlike {@link CurrentUser} which provides access only to the currently authenticated user,
 * this interface allows retrieving information about any user by their ID. This capability
 * is essential for features such as audit trails, activity logs, and displaying user attribution
 * information throughout the application.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Typical use cases include:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Displaying the name of a user who created or modified a record</li>
 *   <li>Retrieving contact information for notification purposes</li>
 *   <li>Resolving user references in data models to their full profile information</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Implementations may choose to cache user information in memory for improved performance,
 * especially for frequently accessed user profiles. However, implementations should consider
 * cache invalidation strategies to ensure that user information remains reasonably up-to-date.
 * </p>
